# structural-color
Python package for modeling structural color in colloidal systems.  

The original code was developed by Sofia Magkiriadou (with contributions from
Jerome Fung and others) during her research [1,2] in the
[Manoharan Lab at Harvard University](http://manoharan.seas.harvard.edu). This
research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number
DMR-1420570 and by an International Collaboration Grant (Grant No.
Sunjin-2010-002) from the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy of Korea.
The code has since been updated. It now works in Python 3, and it can handle
quantities with dimensions (using [pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint)).
